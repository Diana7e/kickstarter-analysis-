#Written Analysis of the Results

## Overview of Project: Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. It will help to answer raised questions
### Purpose: to undestand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges: 
 - we have analyzed data in corelation to ourcomes based on date and based on goals. main challenges are related to narrow down assumptions and normilisation of data set. while i had no issue with this analysys, most of the complexity would come with utlisation of nested formulars and using proper syntaxis and order. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
 -analysis is done based on abolute number  in partiular time of the year across multipl years. outcome and lunch date were main considerations.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 - corelation was established between the goal amount in ranges with relative outcome.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1) Majority of the sucsessful Theater campaigns were launched in May. 
    2) Failed campaigns represent about one third of the population and follow similar trend as Successfull campaigns 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    1) the larger the goal the high probability of failer  
    2) Larger proportion of sucsessful outcomes in "Plays" category were with Goals below 4999 or in a range of 35000 to 44999
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    no data avalible for canselled campaigns. relative data does not always represent real situation as it does not take into acount sesonality , demografics etc 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    there are multiple corelation charts could have beencreated taking into acount multiple data points.
